# Ohio Pride PAC — Project Memory

## Source of truth (read this first)

The **live website files live in a Git repo**, not in this Drive folder.

- **Repo:** https://github.com/zachJCG/OhioPride (public)
- **Default branch:** `main`
- **Clone command:** `git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/zachJCG/OhioPride.git /tmp/OhioPride`

**Always clone the repo first** when the user asks for code changes. Don't try to read site source from Drive — Drive copies (under `Other/OhioPride/` here and `Joseph Carter Group/Internal/OhioPride`) are stale snapshots and frequently lock with `Resource deadlock avoided` from File Stream. Drive is fine for finished docs (PDFs, decks, branded letters); anything that ships to ohiopride.org belongs in the Git repo.

### Standard workflow for site code changes

1. `git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/zachJCG/OhioPride.git /tmp/OhioPride` in the bash sandbox
2. Read whatever files you need from `/tmp/OhioPride/`
3. Build a self-contained patch bundle in `outputs/ohiopride-pr-bundle/`
4. Zip it and return a `computer://` link with a `CHANGES.md`
5. User unpacks it inside their Git checkout and lets Claude Code wire the PR

**If a Drive read fails with `Resource deadlock avoided`, do NOT retry.** Pivot immediately to `git clone` from the repo URL above. The deadlock isn't fixable from inside the session.

## Repo layout (as of 2026-04-27, after `git clone`)

Top-level pages:
- `index.html`, `about.html`, `board.html`, `connect.html`, `contact.html`, `donate.html`, `donate/founding-member.html`, `founding-members.html`, `index.html`, `issues.html`, `launch-day.html`, `methodology.html`, `privacy.html`, `scorecard.html`, `terms.html`
- `issues/<bill_id>.html` — one detail page per bill (hb262, sb113, hjr4, etc.)

JS (in `js/`):
- `bill-data.js` — static `BILLS` array (TO BE REPLACED by Supabase fetch)
- `scorecard-data.js` — static `HOUSE_MEMBERS` / `SENATE_MEMBERS` / `LEGISLATOR_SPONSORSHIPS` (TO BE REPLACED)
- `voting-records.js` — static roll calls + exception map (TO BE REPLACED)
- `news-statements.js` — static news items
- `bill-pipeline.js` — pipeline component
- `bill-detail.js` — bill detail page logic
- `enhancements.js`, `main.js`, `site-template.js`, `ohiopride-data.js`

CSS: `css/style.css`, `css/site-template.css`

Serverless functions (`api/`, Vercel Node runtime, `handler(req, res)` signature):
- `actblue-sync.mjs` — hourly ActBlue donor sync into `founding_members` (Vercel cron in `vercel.json`)
- `bills.mjs`, `scorecard.mjs` — live bill tracker + legislator scorecard data
- `board-members.mjs` — feeds `/board`
- `founding-member-tiers.mjs` — feeds tier cards on `/founding-members` and `/donate/founding-member`
- `founding-members-progress.mjs` — 1,969 progress bar
- `public-members.mjs` — public donor roster, grouped by tier
- `site-leadership.mjs` — footer disclaimer block
- `pride-events.mjs`, `pride-volunteer-submit.mjs` — road-tour pages
- `newsletter-submit.mjs`, `volunteer-submit.mjs` — signup form writes (+ MailerLite sync)
- `contact-submit.mjs` — contact/connect/launch-day forms → `contact_submissions` + Resend email (replaced Netlify Forms)
- `admin-dashboard.mjs`, `admin-email-send.mjs`, `admin-user-manage.mjs` — JWT-gated admin endpoints
- `zip-county-lookup.mjs` — ZIP → county
- `_lib/` — shared helpers (mailerlite, contact-core, http); not exposed as routes

`netlify/` and `netlify.toml` are still in the repo ONLY as the cutover parachute
(Netlify stays deployed but idle for 48h after the DNS flip). Delete both once
Netlify is decommissioned. Old `/.netlify/functions/*` URLs are rewritten to
`/api/*` in `vercel.json`.

Supabase migrations (`supabase/migrations/`, all dated 2026-04-22 onward):
- `20260422015834_initial_schema.sql` — `board_members`, `founding_members` (+ `display_name`, `is_public`, `is_vetted`, `actblue_contribution_id`), `founding_member_tier()` fn, `founding_members_public` view, `founding_members_progress()` rpc
- `20260422020014_configuration_tables.sql` — `founding_member_tiers`, `sponsorship_tiers`, `site_leadership`
- `20260422060000_founding_members_recurrence.sql` — adds `recurrence` to `founding_members`, replaces `founding_member_tier()` to take recurrence
- `20260424000000_scorecard.sql` — `bills`, `roll_calls`, `legislator_vote_exceptions`. NO `legislators` table yet.
- `20260424100000_scorecard_grading.sql` — grading helpers
- `20260424110000_news_statements.sql` — news_statements

## What is and isn't already in Supabase

| Surface              | In DB?  | Page reads from DB?         |
|----------------------|---------|------------------------------|
| Board members        | Yes     | Yes (`board-members.mjs`)    |
| Founding member tiers| Yes     | Yes (`founding-member-tiers.mjs`) |
| Public donor roster  | Yes (view) | Yes (`public-members.mjs`)|
| Progress bar         | Yes (rpc) | Yes (`founding-members-progress.mjs`) |
| Site leadership      | Yes     | Yes (`site-leadership.mjs`)  |
| Bills catalog        | Yes     | **No** — pages still use `js/bill-data.js` |
| Roll calls           | Yes     | **No** — pages still use `js/voting-records.js` |
| Legislators          | **No**  | Static `js/scorecard-data.js` |
| Sponsorships         | **No**  | Static `LEGISLATOR_SPONSORSHIPS` map |

This is the gap closed by Round 3 (PR bundle 20260427-issues-scorecard-supabase).

## Founding member donor reference (for tracker)

Public donor display order is set explicitly via `display_order` column on `founding_members`. Order is **not** by donation date or amount.

| order | name              | amount  | zip   | county      |
|-------|-------------------|---------|-------|-------------|
| 1     | Zachary V Smith   | $25.00  | 45202 | Hamilton    |
| 2     | Jesse Shepherd    | $25.00  | 45248 | Hamilton    |
| 3     | Nicole Green      | $19.69  | 45420 | Montgomery  |
| 4     | Matthew Joseph    | $100.00 | 45420 | Montgomery  |

`county` is **derived from ZIP**, not free-text. Lookup table is `public.ohio_zip_county` (HUD Q1 2023 crosswalk, 1,359 Ohio ZIPs).

## Standing platform decisions

- **DB:** Supabase (Postgres). RLS enabled by default; public read where pages need it.
- **Hosting:** Vercel (migrated from Netlify, July 2026). Functions in `api/*.mjs` (Node ESM, `handler(req, res)`). Routing/headers/crons in `vercel.json`; clean URLs come from `cleanUrls: true`.
- **Donations:** ActBlue. Donor sync runs via `api/actblue-sync.mjs` on an hourly Vercel cron (requires Vercel Pro) into `founding_members`.
- **Forms:** no platform forms product. Public forms POST JSON to `/api/contact-submit`, which writes `public.contact_submissions` and sends the Resend notification.
- **Frontend:** plain HTML + vanilla JS (no framework). Pages fetch from `/api/*` functions (legacy `/.netlify/functions/*` calls still work via a rewrite), which proxy to Supabase using the service-role key (kept server-side).

## Things to never do

- Don't pull live ActBlue donor PII into the repo or a shared doc.
- Don't read/write site code from Drive — always treat the Git repo as source of truth.
- Don't put county into `founding_members` as free text. It's derived from ZIP via the trigger in migration `20260427000001_founding_members_county_from_zip.sql`.
- Don't ship Donor zips/addresses on the public roster — only first name, last initial, city, county.

## Useful queries

```sql
-- Donor roster, in display order, with derived county
SELECT display_order, first_name, last_initial, usps_city, county_name, amount
FROM   public.founding_members
ORDER  BY display_order;

-- ZIP -> primary county
SELECT public.county_for_zip('45420');  -- Montgomery County

-- Legislator scorecard
SELECT * FROM public.legislator_scorecard ORDER BY chamber, district;
```
